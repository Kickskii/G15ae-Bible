316 uncapped fans
318 316 but with capped fans
320 i dont know what they did but the laptop feels smoother most likely a memory management update since one of the user's ram oc which was stable on 318 broke on 320 
also possibly flower fan ramp up but needs testing
331 basically 320 but has a update on the Embedded Controller Firmware
