# Introduction
what is hybrid mode vs dGPU mode and why it affects performance
how to reduce the performance penalty on hybrid mode

## Integrated

### Windows
amd cleanup utility vs DDU
official download area and how to install official drivers
MPT on official drivers
whats still possible with tests
amernime drivers
which one to use
what is flex arch and why am i not using it
tweaks i use
finishing up with setup and getting a different ui
OCD about taskbar icon but its fine
sidenote about gpu now being called something more interesting

take a backup from GPU Z

load it in Morepowertools
click the drop down box and select dGPU
what is what and what even works 
do not mess with feature control unless you know what you're doing
whats the OC limits for and how they might not matter
Vmin/Vmax 
how power limit input does nothing and something at the same time
what TDC limits are 
what is ULV stuff
what is VDDCI and what you can do with it 
whats temprature dependent vmin 
whats in the frequency tab
what are gfx clocks
what is soc clock
what are vclk dclk dcefclk dispclk pixclk phyclk dtbclk and fclk ,boost fclk
how fclk might be locked in vbios and why we still set it higher
whats staticvoltageoffset
what is linear droop
what are DcBtc and DcTol
why fan tab is irrelevant
why not to mess around in the more tab
briefly glance over the parameters on the more curve section
how to tune your gpu
a few starter MPT profiles i have for you to use or mess around with
how to recover if windows will not boot after applying MPT profile
reboot a few times and windwos will ask about startup variables boot to safe mode and delete sppt 

moreclocktool: why you dont exactly need adrenaline software but have it anyways
what you should and shouldnt change
what happens when you change something and your clock is locked to minimum

freesync 
how to turn it on without using amd software //research needed

monitor resolution for benchmarking and why should you care
monitor refresh for benchmarking and why should you still care
how lower than 1080p for monitor resolution doesnt give you more score

benchmarking 


how to get icc profile for your laptop panel

what happens when youre on an unstable gpu tune
what happens if your gpu just doesnt wanna work anymore or appears as "extreme power saver" in armourycrate if youre still using that
why did this happen
how to fix it
how to move on from here
