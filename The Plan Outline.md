# Checklist on what needs to be explained
## like a guideline of a script idk 

Intro
there are timestamps on the video and a extensive checklist in the discription about everything feel free to jump around
join the discord

checking the ram
getting an external display cable
getting new ram + ram recommendations 

checking the performance OOTB
some stock performance numbers with good stock ram
>>should we do ram tuning as the opening?

Disclaimer about damage to your machine being at their own risk we just sharing the findings and methords we the g15ae community found
preach about stability and proper testing 

Disclaimer about performance gain being based on silicon lottery
steps to do before starting
downloading my redone toolbox ((the toolbox is shit please redo it))
reinstalling windows (can be using ReviOS or whatever(example GhostSpectre or Tiny11))
installing Drivers using the toolbox
not having asus shitty bloatware
deleting the dll's from ghelper 

-Disclaimer about AMD Adrenaline Drivers(mention installation of Custom Amernimez Drivers in the GPU section)  (ppt tables being locked after 23.3.2)
-making an excel gathering baselines and noting down performance numbers as well as core clocks
-maybe use CPU Z for baselines for before and after Curve Optimiser single core testing
-show how to disable windows telemetry and driver updates from windows update
disable firmware device to completely block bios updates

Bios Recommendation + why 316 and in which case its fine to use latest(iets)
explaining differences between the bios versions as per personal findings

setting up the Flash drive/SSD for UMAF Bios Editor as well as the Optional downgrade
show how to downgrade the bios
explaining what just happened and what we about to do when we jump into UMAF for the first time
explain the entirety of PBO and what everything is and how it works

setting power limits in Ghelper before starting
PBO limits part 1 -5 test
explain why the -5 test exists
revamp the -5 test to include p95 SSE 60m per core as well as y cruncher for 40m per core
explain why we stress test and why this is EXTREMELY important to do
if they passed the -5 test 
PBO limits part 2 

Introduction to Curve Optimizer
why is it not exactly undervolting
why PerCore and why not just use AllCore
the few methods of doing per core and pro's and cons of them
how to use premade RyzenAdj scripts to do percore for every core one by one
going from high to low this time cause time is of the essence
what error look like
why even a single error at any point is bad
using y cruncher for main testing
having a final test involving 6 iterations of Y cruncher on every core as well as 2 hours of Prime95 on each core

after finishing noting down all performance metrics in the excel sheet/notepad/mobile notes app by doing CPU benchmarks

setting up Task Scheduler and setting it to disabled so as to enable it back up after RAM tuning

WELCOME TO HELL

*insert ram tuning shit in here*




GPU TUNING
*this is pretty chill*
